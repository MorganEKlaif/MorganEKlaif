I'm Morgan! I'm currently a student at Walden University pursuing a business degree and taking programming courses on the side.

I'm currently learning PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and will be looking to create some Bootstrap themes.

I'm looking for help with general UI fundamentals when it comes to the Bootstrap framework and looking to collaborate on a theme that could potentially be sold.
